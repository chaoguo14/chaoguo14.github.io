Hi there! Thanks for visiting my blog.

My name is Chao (IPA: ʈʂʰau1). I work at [Munich Re](https://www.munichre.com/en/homepage/index.html) as a Data Scientist. I have also worked at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) as an Advanced Analytics Analyst. I became interested in machine learning and mathematical statistics while pursuing my B.S. in Mathematics at [UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/). After graduating from UCLA, I went to [Rutgers](https://stat.rutgers.edu/) to take doctoral-level courses, and got my M.S. in Statistics.
