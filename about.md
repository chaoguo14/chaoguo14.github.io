Hi there! Thanks for visiting my blog.

My name is Chao. I am working at [Munich Re](https://www.munichre.com/en/homepage/index.html) as a Statistical Modeler. I have also worked at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) as an Advanced Analytics Analyst.

I became interested in machine learning techniques and mathematical statistics while pursuing my B.S. in Mathematics at [UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/). After graduating from UCLA, I went to [Rutgers](https://stat.rutgers.edu/) to take doctoral-level courses, and got my M.S. in Statistics.

Please feel free to connect to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cguo/).
