title: Property of restricted OLS
---

Last week, I attended a presentation on how to estimate large loss trend. The presentation was interesting, and raised the following question: how to incorporate prior knowledge into estimation, so that the uncertainy of the model can be reduced? This is, of course, a very important and widely-studied question. In fact, one reason why Bayesian statistics attract people is that it can incorporate prior knowledge into the model.

However, since the presentation used a frequentist model, and I am more comfortable with frequentist statistics, I was inspired to think about the following simple question, which is an interesting small exercise:

**Question:** Consider a simple linear regression model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$ where the commonly seen assumptions about regression model hold. Here, $\beta_1 > 0$. Denote the OLS estimator of $\beta_1$ as $\hat{\beta}_1$, and define $\hat{\beta}_1^+ = \max \\{0, \hat{\beta}_1 \\}$. Compare the performance of $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_1^+$.
